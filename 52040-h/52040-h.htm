<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CLERICAL
SUBSCRIPTION AND THE ACT OF UNIFORMITY.</h2>
<p>As it has pleased Her Majesty to appoint a Royal Commission to
consider the subject of Clerical Subscription, the time has
clearly come when those who regard the principle of Subscription
to be one of essential importance to the well-being of our Church
should consider carefully by what arrangements that principle may
be best maintained and carried out.&nbsp; It is the opinion of
many that the wisest course is to endeavour to secure the present
system without alteration, and earnestly to oppose any change of
any kind whatever.&nbsp; Under many circumstances, I could
believe in the wisdom of so doing; but if it can be shown that
there are great objections against the present practice, then I
think that, for the sake of the principle, we ought to be
prepared to receive with gratitude such a change as may remove
well-grounded and reasonable objections.&nbsp; The principle <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and the
practice are so intimately connected in people&rsquo;s minds that
they are almost sure to stand and fall together; so that if there
is any great defect in the practice, there is danger of the
principle being made to bear the blame of it; and if the practice
is such as to give reasonable dissatisfaction to reasonable men,
it is almost sure to weaken the hold which the principle has on
the public mind.&nbsp; On these grounds I am anxious to call the
attention of those Churchmen who believe in the importance of the
principle of Subscription to the practice as at present imposed
by the Act of Uniformity on the beneficed clergymen of the Church
of England; and I do so under the very strong conviction that, in
order to maintain the principle and, I might almost add, on every
other ground, there should be an united endeavour amongst English
Churchmen without delay to effect a change.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My reasons are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The Subscription, as now required of all
incumbents, is required not by the Church, but by the
State.&nbsp; The Church of England is in no sense responsible for
it, having never either sought or sanctioned it.&nbsp; As the
Church of England has always held the principle of Subscription,
so it has provided a form.&nbsp; This form was first prepared in
Convocation, and then sanctioned by James I., by virtue of his
prerogative royal, and supreme authority in causes
ecclesiastical.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>This is
the form embodied in the thirty-sixth Canon, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That the King&rsquo;s Majesty, under God, is the only
supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highnesses
dominions and countries, as well in all spiritual or
ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal; and that no foreign
prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate hath, or ought to
have, any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence, or
authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within his
Majesty&rsquo;s said realms, dominions, and countries.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That the Book of Common Prayer, and of ordering of
bishops, priests, and deacons, containeth in it nothing contrary
to the Word of God, and that it may lawfully so be used; and that
he himself will use the form in the said book prescribed, in
publick prayer, and administration of the Sacraments, and none
other.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That he alloweth the Book of Articles of Religion,
agreed upon by the archbishops and bishops of both provinces, and
the whole clergy in the Convocation, holden at London, in the
year of our Lord 1562; and that he acknowledgeth all and every
the articles therein contained, being in number nine-and-thirty,
besides the ratification, to be agreeable to the Word of God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But the Church&rsquo;s form was too temperate for the
vindictive spirit of Charles II. and his Parliament; and
therefore, without consulting the Church at all, the King&rsquo;s
Majesty, with the consent of the Lords and Commons, enacted a new
form of Subscription, and imposed it on all those who either held
any benefice <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>at the time, or should hereafter be presented to
one.&nbsp; No one, therefore, need fear that his allegiance to
the Church would be in any manner compromised by his
disapprobation of the form of Subscription required by the Act of
Uniformity; for the Church has never had anything to do with it
beyond bearing the blame.&nbsp; It is a test imposed on Churchmen
by Act of Parliament, without the concurrence of the Church
itself, and virtually supersedes the form which the Church has
provided.&nbsp; It appears to me, therefore, that loyalty to our
Church would lead us respectfully to petition for the repeal of
the Parliamentary enactment, that so our Church may be permitted
to carry out her own principles, and make use of the form
deliberately drawn up by Convocation, and sanctioned by the
Crown.##</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; It is impossible to prove a negative; and I may be
mistaken: but I am not able to discover that such a form of
Subscription as that required by the Act of Uniformity was ever
known in the whole history of Christendom.&nbsp; Churches, one
after another, have drawn up Confessions of Faith, and employed
them as tests of opinion in the admission of their
ministers.&nbsp; Most Churches have prepared liturgical forms for
devotional purposes, and required the use of these forms in
public worship.&nbsp; The Confession of Faith has been carefully
drawn up for one object, and the Liturgy for another; the one to
secure sound doctrine, and the other pure devotional
worship.&nbsp; So the Church of England, in <i>its</i> form of
Subscription, has <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>kept the distinction perfectly clear.&nbsp; It requires
the new incumbent to subscribe &ldquo;that he alloweth the Book
of Articles to be agreeable to the Word of God,&rdquo; thereby
giving a positive acknowledgment of their truth.&nbsp; But of the
devotional book, the Book of Common Prayer, it requires him to
sign,&mdash;&ldquo;That it containeth in it nothing contrary to
the Word of God, and that it may lawfully so be used, and that he
himself will use the form in the said book prescribed, in publick
prayer and administration of the Sacraments, and none
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Book of Articles is employed as a
Confession of Faith, or test of opinion; whereas all that is
required respecting the Book of Common Prayer is the promise to
use it, with the declaration that there is nothing wrong in so
doing.&nbsp; But this temperate spirit of the Church was not
sufficient for the purposes of Charles and his Parliament.&nbsp;
The persons whom they wanted to turn out believed in the
Articles, and were, many of them, quite willing to use the
Prayer-book.&nbsp; Thus the Church&rsquo;s principles were
insufficient for their ejection, and, in order to get rid of
them, the plan was devised of omitting all specific mention of
the Articles, and making use of the whole book as the test or
confession of faith.&nbsp; A long devotional book of 400 pages,
containing prayers, Psalms as pointed for chanting, rubrics,
addresses, and special services, some of which can be used by the
Bishops only, are all massed together, and made into a new
exclusive creed.&nbsp; There is no exception made for
anything.&nbsp; &ldquo;All and every thing&rdquo; is alike
included, and <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>the language is made as stringent as possible.&nbsp; It
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I, A. B., do hereby declare my unfeigned
assent and consent to all and every thing contained and
prescribed in and by the book intituled, The Book of Common
Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and
Ceremonies of the Church, according to the uses of the Church of
England; together with the Psalter, or Psalms of David, pointed
as they are to be said or sung in Churches; and the form or
manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of Bishops,
Priests, and Deacons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never, I believe, was a more flagrant misuse of any
document.&nbsp; The book was prepared for one purpose, and then,
for party ends, employed for another.&nbsp; Prayers were made
into creeds; the pointing of the Psalms into a test of opinion;
and rubrics into confessions of faith.&nbsp; Fortunately, there
is wonderfully little in the book, taken as a whole, to wound the
conscience of those who subscribe to the Articles.&nbsp; But that
is not the point.&nbsp; The real question is, whether prayers,
pointings, rubrics, &amp;c., should be employed as creeds.&nbsp;
My own belief is, that they never ought to be; for, if there is
the accuracy of the creed, there cannot be the devotional warmth
of the prayer; that they never have been, except in this
instance; and that they would not have been, even in 1662, had it
not been for the spirit of retaliation, which, unhappily, induced
the King and Parliament to agree in passing the Act of
Uniformity.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But as the form of Subscription is Wrong in <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>principle, so
to many conscientious minds it becomes painful in practice.</p>
<p>In a long devotional book it is next to impossible that all
and everything should be exactly to the mind of any one, and of
all the thousands of clergymen who regard the Liturgy as amongst
the most sacred possessions ever given to a Church I believe
there are very few who would not rejoice over a slight change
here and there, if only they could be sure that no changes which
they disapproved would be introduced with those they would
approve.&nbsp; Looking at the book in its comprehensive
character, as containing a Calendar of Lessons, a vast number of
rubrics, the Psalms pointed for chanting, and several occasional
services, it is vain to expect that every point of detail shall
be exactly to the mind of any man.&nbsp; However decided the
general approval, there must of necessity be points of detail
which grate, to say the least, on the feelings, if they are not
opposed to the judgment.&nbsp; Thus there are many persons who
believe that there is nothing contrary to God&rsquo;s Word in the
Prayer-book, and that it may be lawfully used, who still consider
that &ldquo;assent and consent to all and every thing&rdquo; is
too strong a term to express their state of mind respecting
it.&nbsp; The result is that some are deterred from entering the
ministry, others decline or resign preferment; while many others
would consider it a great relief if the form in the Canon were
substituted for that in the Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; But there is another objection of a much <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>graver
character, and one which, in these days of loose opinion, is, I
believe, far more important than any already mentioned.&nbsp; By
the confusion of the Articles and the ritual in one form of
Subscription the door is opened for great laxity as to
doctrine.</p>
<p>To meet the difficulty which conscientious persons may feel
with reference to the ritual, our Church, in the preface, claims
for the book that it shall &ldquo;be allowed such just and
favourable construction as in common equity ought to be allowed
to all human writings, especially such as are set forth by
authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is supposed, therefore, by the Church,
that each clergyman will put his own favourable construction on
the details of the book, which, as a whole, he greatly values;
and, provided that he does not consider any portion contrary to
God&rsquo;s Word, she is prepared to entrust him with the use of
it in the public ministry.&nbsp; Now, such a principle as this is
all very well with reference to forms, but becomes inexpressibly
dangerous when applied to doctrines.&nbsp; It is only right that
men should be allowed to entertain their own opinion respecting
the selection of lessons in the calendar; but the very life of
the Church is imperilled if we admit a similar latitude
respecting the essential truths of Christianity.&nbsp; Thus, the
Act of Uniformity, by confusing the two in one form of
Subscription, practically opens the way for laxity of religious
belief.&nbsp; It puts those who do not believe in the Thirty-nine
Articles in the same position as those who think that mistakes
have been made in the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>calendar, or that the mind of the
Church would be better expressed if two or three sentences
amongst the occasional services were omitted or slightly
modified.&nbsp; The favourable construction which is necessary
for a comprehensive ritual is claimed equally for the confession
of faith, and the denial of revealed truth is placed on the same
level as a scruple about a rubric.&nbsp; To the mind of Charles
and his advisers I am inclined to think that the two were of
equal importance, or possibly the forms were more important than
the doctrines.&nbsp; But men of all classes are now, thank God,
waking up to the conviction that all matters of ritual are as
nothing when compared with the truth as revealed in Scripture;
and it is lamentable to think that those who deny such a doctrine
as the Atonement should be no more condemned by their
Subscription than are those conscientious men who are made
uncomfortable by a few trifling matters in the ritual.</p>
<p>The conclusion, therefore, is that, just in proportion as we
value Divine truth, we should endeavour to fall back on the
wisdom of our forefathers, who kept the two things quite
distinct; and that there ought to be two forms of Subscription,
as directed by the Canon, instead of one, as required by the Act
of Uniformity; that so our adhesion to the great scriptural and
essential truths of the Gospel may stand out, as the Church has
placed it, quite distinct from our approbation of the various
details of the ritual.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But it
is frequently argued that, if we touch any portion of the Act of
Uniformity, the whole would be endangered; and it is regarded as
so sacred a bulwark around the truth that no risk must be
incurred respecting it.</p>
<p>Now, I believe that this respect for the Act of Uniformity
arises simply from the fact that no one reads it.&nbsp; The
greater part has long since become a dead-letter, and if the
whole were swept away our position would be very slightly
changed.&nbsp; The following is a short summary:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the Book of Common Prayer as revised in 1660
should be used instead of that of Edward VI.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That all parsons, vicars, or other ministers should
subscribe, according to the form above given, before the Feast of
St. Bartholomew, 1662; or within one month be deprived, <i>ipso
facto</i>, of their spiritual promotions.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That every person who may hereafter be presented to
any living make the same Subscription.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That every resident incumbent, where a curate is
kept, read the common prayers and service at least once a month,
or forfeit 5<i>l.</i> to the poor of the parish, on conviction
before two justices of the peace.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That all deans, canons, &amp;c., and even tutors in
private families, shall subscribe a declaration against
rebellion, a promise to conform to the Liturgy, and until the
year 1682 a renunciation of the Solemn League and Covenant.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That no person shall act as schoolmaster or private
tutor in any family without a licence from the Bishop, and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>that any
person teaching without a licence shall be liable to imprisonment
for three months and a fine of 5<i>l.</i></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; That no person shall be admitted to any benefice who
is not in holy orders by episcopal ordination; or administer the
Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper unless he be ordained priest
by episcopal ordination, upon pain of a penalty of
100<i>l.</i></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; That the penalties in this Act shall not extend to
foreigners or aliens of the Foreign Reformed Churches allowed, or
to be allowed, by the King&rsquo;s Majesty, his heirs and
successors in England.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; That all heads of colleges read the Morning Prayer in
their college chapel at least once in every quarter, upon pain to
lose and be suspended of and from all benefits and profits
belonging to the same Government or Headship by the space of six
months.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; That all lecturers or preachers shall, on their
admission and on the first lecture day in every month afterwards,
read the prayers for the time of the day, and shall afterwards
declare their unfeigned assent and consent to the Book of Common
Prayer according to the prescribed form; that if they neglect to
do so they shall be disabled to preach the said or any other
lecture; and that if they preach when so disabled they shall
suffer three months&rsquo; imprisonment in the common gaol
without bail or main-prise.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; That whenever a sermon or lecture is to be preached
the common prayer and service for that time of the day must be
read.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; That previous statutes be not repealed.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; That the parishioners of the several parishes
procure copies of the Prayer-book before the Feast of St.
Bartholomew, 1662.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>14.&nbsp; That the Book be translated into Welsh.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; That provision be made for the preservation of the
Book in Cathedrals and other places.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; That the Thirty-sixth Article be understood as
applying to the book mentioned in this Act as it did heretofore
to that of Edward VI.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; That the form of prayer heretofore in use shall
remain so until the Feast of St. Bartholomew, 1662.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Now what is there in all this that is worth preserving? and
what barrier does it present against the inroads of error?&nbsp;
The greater part was intended only for the day, and had done its
work before the close of the year 1662.&nbsp; Of the remainder
there is very little which has not long since fallen into
abeyance.&nbsp; Rectors are never fined 5<i>l.</i> if they fail
in reading prayers once a month.&nbsp; Tutors in private families
never subscribe any declaration against rebellion, and are never
imprisoned for teaching without the licence of the Bishop.&nbsp;
Heads of Colleges are neither suspended nor deprived if they fail
to read prayers once a quarter in their college chapels.&nbsp;
Lecturers never repeat their declaration of assent and consent on
the first lecture day in each month, and yet are never
imprisoned.&nbsp; And the Litany is constantly used even by our
Bishops in the place of Evening Prayer.&nbsp; All that we want to
preserve as of present and practical importance is the adoption
of the Liturgy as revised in 1660, and <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the necessity of Episcopal
ordination.&nbsp; For aught I know these may be secured by other
statutes; but if not, there would be no difficulty in securing
them, though the whole Act of Uniformity were repealed.&nbsp; Or
if it is thought desirable that so celebrated an Act of
Parliament ought to be preserved as a curious specimen of bygone
vindictive legislation, let an amendment be introduced
substituting the form of Subscription in the Canon for that
required by the Act.&nbsp; If this were done, the Church would be
permitted to guard its ministry according to its own principles;
many tender consciences would be relieved, and an important step
would be taken towards the attainment of the great object of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Commission, viz., the simplification of Clerical
Subscription &ldquo;consistently with due security for the
declared agreement of the clergy with the doctrines of the
Church, and conformity to its ritual.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
